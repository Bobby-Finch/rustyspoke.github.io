The Rusty spoke was founded in the fall of 2008 in the back yard of the long house art gallery on fifth street and Roosevelt.

The collective was formed out of the growing interest in other community bicycle coops/collectives throughout Arizona and the country.
The collective started with 4 core members with some knowledge and a small amount of tools and used parts.

Over the first year we began to grow out of our small backyard space and moved to a larger space on Grand Ave. located on the west side of downtown.
We then moved again right down the street on Fillmore and Grand Ave, before finally settling in our current location at 9th Ave. and Grant St.

The shop has always maintained a DIY ethos with a commitment to provide a safe space to all people.
Most things in the shop have been built or donated to us.
The shop has also maintained a close relationship to other grassroots organizations that promote positive and radical thinking, workshops, and projects.
